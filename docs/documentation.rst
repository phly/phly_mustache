phly_mustache
=============
``phly_mustache`` is a `Mustache <http://mustache.github.com>`_
implementation written for PHP 5.3+. It conforms to the principles of
mustache , and allows for extension of the format via pragmas.

Mustache is primarily a syntax and specification for templating. The
basic concepts are:

* **Templates**, which contain a variety of tokens, delimited with double
  braces, or mustaches: `{{` and `}}`. These typically are used for
  variable substitution, but a variety of simple control structures and
  mechanisms for dealing with iterable or hierarchical datasets are also
  provided.
* **Views**, which provide subsitutions for *templates*. In PHP, these
  can be either associative arrays or objects. Member variables may be
  any valid PHP values, including callbacks; when callbacks are used,
  the return value will be substituted -- which provides a mechanism for
  computing values, filtering them, etc.

This guide will take you through the basics of using the
``phly_mustache`` library, as well as provide a thorough reference of
the syntax supported, as well as implementation-specific features.
